### Description
To complete the task, you need:
1. To edit the ```hosts``` file so that requests to the ```netology.homework``` address are redirected to your local computer (```127.0.0.1```)
2. Improve the <a href="https://github.com/imLIVI/ClientServerApp-OSI.git">previous task</a> so that it works through the address ```netology.homework```, and communication took place in several (3-5) steps, in the form of a dialogue
